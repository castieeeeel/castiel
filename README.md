# Silver Bullet

Silver Bullet (SB) is an extensible, open source **personal knowledge
platform**. At its core it‚Äôs a clean markdown-based writing/note taking
application that stores your _pages_ (notes) as plain markdown files in a folder
referred to as a _space_. Pages can be cross-linked using the
`[[link to other page]]` syntax. This makes it a simple tool for
[Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).
However, once you leverage its various extensions (called _plugs_) it can feel
more like a _knowledge platform_, allowing you to annotate, combine and query
your accumulated knowledge in creative ways specific to you.

## Features
* **Free and open source**. Silver Bullet is MIT licensed.
* **The truth is in the markdown.** Silver Bullet doesn‚Äôt use proprietary file formats. It keeps its data as plain markdown files on disk. While SB uses a database for indexing and caching some indexes, all of that can be rebuilt from its markdown source at any time. If SB would ever go away, you can still read your pages with any text editor.
* **One single, distraction free mode.** SB doesn‚Äôt have a separate view and edit mode. It doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúfocus mode.‚Äù You‚Äôre always in focused edit mode, why wouldn‚Äôt you?
* **Keyboard oriented**. You can use SB fully using the keyboard, typin‚Äô the keys.
* **Extend it your way**. SB is highly extensible with [plugs](https://silverbullet.md/üîå_Plugs), and you can customize it to your liking and your workflows.

## Installing Silver Bullet

To run Silver Bullet create a folder for your pages (it can be empty, or be an
existing folder with `.md` files) and run the following command in your
terminal:

    deno run -A --unstable https://get.silverbullet.md <pages-path>

However, because this command is not super easy to remember, you may install it
as well:

    deno install -f --name silverbullet -A --unstable https://get.silverbullet.md

This will create a `silverbullet` (feel free to replace `silverbullet` in this
command with whatever you like) alias in your `~/.deno/bin` folder. Make sure
this path is in your `PATH` environment variable.

This allows you to install Silver Bullet simply as follows:

    silverbullet <pages-path>

By default, SB will bind to port `3000`, to use a different port use the
`--port` flag. By default SB doesn‚Äôt offer any sort of authentication, to add
basic password authentication, pass the `--password` flag.

Once downloaded and booted, SB will print out a URL to open SB in your browser
(spoiler alert: by default this will be http://localhost:3000 ).

#protip: If you have a PWA enabled browser (like any browser based on Chromium)
hit that little button right of the location bar to install SB, and give it its
own window frame (sans location bar) and desktop/dock icon. At last the PWA has
found its killer app.

## Upgrading Silver Bullet

Simply run this:

    deno cache --reload https://get.silverbullet.md

And restart Silver Bullet. You should be good to go.

## Developing Silver Bullet

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet)

Silver Bullet is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
built on top of the excellent [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/) editor
component. Additional UI is built using React.js.
[ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) is used to build both the front-end and
back-end bundles. The server backend runs as a HTTP server on node.js using
express.

After cloning the repo, run the following command to install some convenience
scripts (`silverbullet` and `plugos-bundle` into your `~/.deno/bin`):

```shell
deno task install
```

To prepare the initial web and plug build run:

```shell
deno task build
```

You can then run the server in ‚Äúwatch mode‚Äù (automatically restarting when you
change source files) with:

```shell
deno task watch-server -- <PATH-TO-YOUR-SPACE>
```

After this initial build, it's convenient to run three commands in parallel (in
separate terminals):

```shell
deno task watch-web
deno task watch-server -- <PATH-TO-YOUR-SPACE>
deno task watch-plugs
```
