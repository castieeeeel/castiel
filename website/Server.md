Installing SilverBullet as a (local) web server is the most mature, and most flexible way to install SilverBullet. If mature and flexible is your thing, try this option!

The idea is simple: you run the web server (instructions below), point your browser at it and _go, go, go_! You can access the URL via your desktop browser, but also a mobile one. This makes it a great option to access your space from various devices without requiring any type of sync. You could even go _full-on YOLO_ (that’s a technical term), and install it on a public cloud server somewhere and access it that way (be sure to at least enable authentication and put SSL on top of it, though).

## Supported operating systems
* 64-bit Linux
* Intel or Apple Silicon macOS
* **Windows is currently not supported**, if there’s demand for it let us know. We recommend using [[Desktop]] on Windows instead.

You have two options to install and run SilverBullet as a server:

1. Installation right on your host system
2. Running it with Docker

## Regular installation
Run the following in your terminal:

```shell
curl https://silverbullet.md/install.sh | sh
```

This will determine your operating system and download the appropriate `silverbullet` into your current folder. You will likely want to move it to a more convenient location in your PATH (made sure this is a place where it's writable for future upgrades.)

To run SilverBullet, create a folder for your pages (it can be empty, or be an existing folder with `.md` files) and run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
./silverbullet <pages-path>
```

By default, SilverBullet will bind to port `3000`, to use a different port use the `--port` flag. 

For security reasons, by default SilverBullet only allows connections via `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`). To also allow connections from the network, pass a `--hostname 0.0.0.0` flag (0.0.0.0 for all connections, or insert a specific address to limit the host), ideally combined with `--user username:password` to add BasicAuth password protection.

Once downloaded and booted, SilverBullet will print out a URL to open SB in your browser.

## Upgrading SilverBullet
SilverBullet is regularly updated. To get the latest and greatest, simply run:

```shell
./silverbullet upgrade
```

If all goes well, this will upgrade silverbullet in-place. After the upgrade, restart SilverBullet. You should be good to go.

## Installing SilverBullet with Docker

There is a [docker image on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zefhemel/silverbullet). To use it, first create a volume to keep your space (markdown) files:

```shell
docker volume create myspace
```

Then, run the container, e.g. as follows:

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v myspace:/space -d --name silverbullet zefhemel/silverbullet
```

If you'd like to pass in additional command line arguments (e.g. `--user` to add authentication) you can just append those to the command, e.g.:

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v myspace:/space -d --name silverbullet zefhemel/silverbullet --user me:letmein
```

To build your own version of the docker image, run `./scripts/build_docker.sh`.

You can also use docker-compose if you prefer. From a silverbullet check-out run:

```shell
PORT=3000 docker-compose up
```

or similar.

To upgrade, simply pull the latest docker image (rebuilt and pushed after every commit to "main") and start the new container.

```shell
docker pull zefhemel/silverbullet
```

Docker images are also available based on version, have a look at the [docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/zefhemel/silverbullet).
