Commands define actions that SilverBullet can perform. They range from simple edit commands, such as {[Text: Bold]}, but may be more elaborate such as {[Page: Rename]}. 

SilverBullet ships with a lot of commands built in, but custom ones can also be defined using [[Templates]] and [[Plugs]].

All available commands appear in the [[Command Palette]] but may have key bindings as well (these key bindings appear in the [[Command Palette]] and are configurable in [[SETTINGS]]).
