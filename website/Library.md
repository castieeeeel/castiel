A lot of useful functionality in SilverBullet is implemented through [[Templates]], as well as regular [[Pages]].

For example:
* [[Snippets]] exposed via [[Slash Commands]]
* [[Live Template Widgets]] such as the [[Table of Contents]] and [[Linked Mentions]]
* Various useful [[Page Templates]]
* General purpose pages such as [[Library/Core/Page/Maintenance]] and [[Library/Core/Page/Templates]]

By default, SilverBullet doesnâ€™t ship with these built in. Instead, you can selective decide to import _libraries_ of these templates. Once imported, you can edit them, add to them, or delete them as you see fit.

Currently, we have the following libraries available:

* [[Library/Core]]: this is the library you want to import _for sure_. Just do it.
* [[Library/Journal]]: for the journalers among us.
