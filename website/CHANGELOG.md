An attempt at documenting of the changes/new features introduced in each release.

---

## 0.0.35
* Big refactor of the internal Space API unifying attachment and page handling. This shouldn't affect (most) existing code and plugs (except some more exotic areas), but if stuff breaks, please report it.
* Technical change: Upgrades are now detected on the server-side, and plugs re-loaded and pages indexed upon every upgrade.
* Various bug fixes (e.g. using HTML tags in a page before completely broke syntax highlighting)
* Exposed `fulltext.*` syscalls on the client

---
## 0.0.34
* Change to attachment handling: the `attachment/` prefix for links and images is no longer used, if you already had links to attachments in your notes, you will need to remove the `attachment/` prefix manually. Sorry about that.
* Improved styling for completion (especially slash commands)
* Completion for commands using the (undocumented) `{[Command Syntax]}` ‚Äî¬†yep, that exists.

---

## 0.0.33
* **Attachments**: you can now copy & paste, or drag & drop files (images, PDF, whatever you like) into a page and it will be uploaded and appropriately linked from your page. Attachment size is currently limited to 100mb.
* Changed full-text search page prefix from `@search/` to `üîç` for the {[Search Space]} command.
* `page`, `plug` and `attachment` are now _reserved page names_, you cannot name your pages these (you will get an error when explicitly navigating to them).

---

## 0.0.32
* **Inline image previews**: use the standard `![alt text](https://url.com/image.jpg)` notation and a preview of the image will appear automatically. Example:

* **Dark mode**. Toggle between the dark and light mode using a new button, top-right.

* **Named anchors** and references, create an anchor with the new @anchor notation (anywhere on a page), then reference it locally via [[@anchor]] or cross page via [[CHANGELOG@anchor]].

---
## 0.0.31
* Update to the query language: the `render` clause now uses page reference syntax `[[page]]`. For example `render [[template/task]]` rather than `render "template/task"`. The old syntax still works, but is deprecated, completion for the old syntax has been removed.
* Updates to templates:
  * For the `Template: Instantiate Page` command, the page meta value `$name` is now used to configure the page name (was `name` before). Also if `$name` is the only page meta defined, it will remove the page meta entirely when instantiating.
  * You can now configure a daily note prefix with `dailyNotePrefix` in `SETTINGS` and create a template for your daily note under `template/page/Daily Note` (configurable via the `dailyNoteTemplate` setting).
  * You can now set a quick note prefix with `quickNotePrefix` in `SETTINGS`.
* Directives (e.g. `#query`, `#import`, `#use`) changes:
  * Renamed `#template` directive to `#use-verbose`
  * New `#use` directive will clean all the embedded queries and templates in its scope
  * All directives now use the page reference syntax `[[page name]]` instead of `"page name"`, this includes `#use` and `#use-verbose` as well as `#import`.
  * The `link` query provider now also returns the `pos` of a link (in addition to the `page`)
  * New `$disableDirectives` page metadata attribute can be used to disable directives processing in a page (useful for templates)
* Added a new `/hr` slash command to insert a horizontal rule (`---`) useful for mobile devices (where these are harder to type)

---
## 0.0.30
* Slash commands now only trigger after a non-word character to avoid "false positives" like "hello/world".
* Page auto complete now works with slashes in the name.
* Having a `SETTINGS` page is now mandatory. One is auto generated if none is present.
* Added an `indexPage` setting to set the index page for the space (which by default is `index`). When navigating to this page, the page name will "disappear" from the URL. That is, the index URL will simply be `http://localhost:3000/`.
  * This feature is now used in `website` and set to `Silver Bullet` there. To also make the title look nicer when visiting https://silverbullet.md

---
## 0.0.29
* Added the `Link: Unfurl` command, which is scoped to only work (and be visible) when used on ‚Äúnaked URLs‚Äù, that is: URLs not embedded in a link or other place, such as this one: https://silverbullet.md
  * Plugs can implement their own unfurlers by responding to the `unfurl:options` event (see the [Twitter plug](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet-twitter) for an example).
  * Core implements only one unfurl option: ‚ÄúExtract title‚Äù which pulls the `<title>` tag from the linked URL and replaces it with a `[bla](URL)` style link.
* Removed status bar: to further simplify the SB UI. You can still pull up the same stat on demand with the `Stats: Show` command.
* The page switcher is now maintaining its ordering based on, in order:
  1. Last opened pages (in current session)
  2. Last modified date (on disk)
  3. Everything else
  4. The currently open page (at the bottom)
* Filter boxes (used for the page switching and command palette among other things) now also support PgUp, PgDown, Home and End and have some visual glitches fixed as well.
* Reverted exposing an empty `window` object to sandboxes running in workers and node.js (introduced in 0.0.28)
* Renamed Markdown-preview related commands to something more consistent
