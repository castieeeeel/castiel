This is the future implementation of [[Linked Mentions]], but we need to release 0.7.0 first thatâ€™s why this is disabled for now.

```block
{{#let @linkedMentions = query("link where toPage = ? and page != ? order by page", @page.name, @page.name)}}
{{#if @linkedMentions}}
# Linked Mentions
{{#each @linkedMentions}}
* [[{{ref}}]]: `{{snippet}}`
{{/each}}
{{/if}}
{{/let}}
```
