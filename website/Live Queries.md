Live Queries are a [[Blocks|block]] that generates a (quasi) live view on various data sources, usually [[Objects]], and renders their results inline via [[Live Preview]] either as a table or using [[Templates]].

The syntax used is:

    ```query
    page limit 3
    ```

Queries are written using SilverBulletâ€™s [[Query Language]].
